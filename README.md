## Project Title
Ecological Well Being and Mental Health
## Desciption
While people from all around the world are trying to built self sustaining residential areas, in Turkey more and more forests are cut down to build traditional buildings and a war againts 'green' seems to be on for a while. Meanwhile there are researhes suggesting that even the fake visual of a natural environement can make the healing process much faster. In this study, a comparison between the amount of hectares vanished from Turkeyâ€™s forests and number of people hospitalised due to psychological disorders throughout 10 cities between 2009 and 2013 is intended to be shown.

## Project Procedure: describe your data processing, visualization selection, and analyses post-visualization
I have first started my final project with the aim of visualizing the my thesis bibliography in a network map. However after reading the news on how we have cut down the forest in Istanbul to build a bridge that is absolutaly harder to use have effected birds, turtles and other animals living in the area, I was angry. I wanted to show people that it directly effects us as well, even if these people do not care about animals. I have looked at respiratory disaeses, as it is the one that comes to mind. However it was too obvious of a relationship and I knew it effected more than that. So I have researched and found out the number of patients that have visisted the hospital in mental health related issues and tried to idendify if it is a contributing facter too, to our stress and other mental related problems.
