<p>While people from all around the world are trying to built self sustaining residential areas, in Turkey more and more forests are cut down to build traditional buildings and a war against 'green' seems to be on for a while. Meanwhile there are researches suggesting that even the fake visual of a natural environment can make the healing process much faster.The concept of ‘Ecopsychiatry' was  first invented in the late 1970s by the American Psychiatric Association. The term tries to apply ecological construct in the study and practice of psychiatry. J.E. Edgerton from APA describes it as “Scientfic concept describing the basic and applied relationship between living things and their environment. These are assumed, by their presence or absence, to affect mental health”. In this study, a comparison between the amount of hectares vanished from Turkey’s forests and number of people hospitalized due to psychological disorders, in one of the most populated Istanbul and the other one being Sinop which has one of the richest forest diversity in Turkey. The interval between 2009 and 2013 is intended to be shown.  </p>

<p>I have first started my final project with the aim of visualizing the my thesis bibliography in a network map. However after reading the news on how we have cut down the forest in Istanbul to build a bridge that is absolutely harder to use have effected birds, turtles and other animals living in the area, I was angry. I wanted to show people that it directly effects us as well, even if these people do not care about animals. I have looked at respiratory diseases, as it is the one that comes to mind. However it was too obvious of a relationship and I knew it effected more than that. So I have researched and found out the number of patients that have visited the hospital in mental health related issues and tried to identify if it is a contributing factor too, to our stress and other mental related problems. After visualizing I have realized that in order to properly have a comment or an insight from it we need a lot more years and a lot more details. Ofcourse the only reason for mental health problems is not deforastation, but with ecopsychiatry I believe it is a factor. Although the relationship is not that clear or as sharp we can seen an increase in both at the same times. To further explore this idea I would scale this up to a region, probably Europe and try to find more data that dates back to at least 1990's. </p>
